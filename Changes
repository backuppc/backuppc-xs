Revision history for Perl extension BackupPC-XS.

0.57: Dec 2, 2017

    - added BackupPC::XS::DirOps::refCountAllInodeMax() and bpc_path_refCountAllInodeMax() to allow
      BackupPC_refCountAll to get the largest inode as the backup tree is traversed.

0.56: Jun 11, 2017

    - change to Makefile.PL to ensure that parallel builds (make -j N) work with BSD make
      (pull request #4 from Alexander Moisseev).

0.55: Jun 4, 2017

    - updated Makefile.PL so ./configure is run before subdirs are built when parallel make (eg: make -j 4) is used

    - generate error message instead of log message if bpc_poolWrite_unmarkPendingDelete() fails

    - added & ~S_IFMT to chmod() mode argument

0.54: May 25, 2017

    - checks the return value of check the return value of bpc_fileZIO_read() in BackupPC::XS::FileZIO::read()

    - fixed memory leak on file open error return in bpc_fileZIO.c, and another more minor leak in bpc_dirOps.c.

    - added default #define ACCESSPERMS 0777 for Solaris

0.53: March 23, 2017

      in bpc_attribCache_getDirEntries().

    - updated config.guess and config.sub; fixes problem with aarch64 and ppc64le
      reported by Denis Fateyev.

0.51: March 5, 2017

    - added dynamic:: target to subdir Makefile.PLs to fix build issue on gentoo
      (patch submitted by Slaven Rezic; see https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=120495)

0.50: March 3, 2017

    - Reference counting is now per-backup; replaced static delta information with callable interface.

    - several bug fixes 
    
0.40: June 18, 2016

    - Significant rewrite of bpc_hashTable.c so that resizing doesn't move the entries. The nodes are stored as pointers

    - Updated Makefile.PL to make it more robust on different platforms. Reported
      by Alexander Moisseev.
